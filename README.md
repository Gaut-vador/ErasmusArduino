# ErasmusArduino

This project consist of making a program in C language to allow a robot, build with an Arduino Leonardo chip, a Pixy camera and a ZumoMotor wheels, to follow a pipe with gaz inside and detect breachs and obstacles in it path.
To do that, it need a black line on the floor to follow it. The camera will search independently for failures in the pipe and stop the robot, take and send a picture via Bluetooth and then continue on it's way.
If the line is obstructed, the robot will send a a picture of what is on it way and go back to the begining of the line.

This project is the subject of an internship of 3 months in Greece with the ERASMUS Program.

It's made by Gauthier PIRLET and Nathan WAETERS.

Some pictures of the robot are in the folder "data".
